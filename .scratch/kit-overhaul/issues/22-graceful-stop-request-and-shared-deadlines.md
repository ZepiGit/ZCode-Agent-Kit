# 22: Graceful stop request `POST /__kit/stop`, shared deadlines and the manager's stop path

**Blocked by:** 18 (Per-spawn proxy environment: stop token and log dir set by the manager, token stripped from the respawn hook), 21 (Health supervisor: one graceful shutdown sequence, footprint thresholds 512/1024 MB), 40 (UX batch (a): `doctor`, `proxy start/status/stop/restart/logs`, connection details)

**Status:** ready-for-agent

Model: sol

Risk: high

ADR: 0014

**What to build:** The route sits after Host, Origin and bearer checks and requires the stop-token header; both compared in constant time incl. length; no CORS allowance; without a token it answers the unknown-route `404 not_found_error`. No body, bypasses admission, answers 202 before the drain, triggers the single graceful sequence. One shared module holds `STOP_GRACE_MS = 10_000` and `STOP_EXIT_MARGIN_MS`; the manager forces only after both. The manager sends the request on Windows and POSIX after the identity proof; POSIX falls back to SIGTERM on 404/401/403/connection error, Windows to `TerminateProcess`. `recoverHung`, startup timeout, foreign-port paths and golden-path crash injection force directly through an explicit force helper. `proxy stop`/`restart` show progress on a TTY, line-based elsewhere.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Seam 4: auth order (Host/Origin/bearer before token), wrong/short/long token rejected, 404 without a token, 202, bypass while the byte cap is saturated, listener open during drain.
- [ ] Seam 2: fallbacks per status/OS against an old proxy; force paths never send the request; deadline test (manager force point > proxy deadline; respawn wait 30 s > 10 s + grace + margin).
- [ ] windows-latest: `proxy stop` runs the account-metadata flush (marker in the log) — build-time gate 5.
- [ ] Snapshot for the stop/restart progress (TTY) and line mode.

**Common acceptance (every ticket):**

- [ ] tests start RED and turn GREEN at the named seam
- [ ] the fast suite and the `memory-budget` job stay green on ubuntu and windows
- [ ] new test files are wired into a script (wiring guard, ticket 04)
- [ ] no pre-existing test changes without a justification in the ticket
- [ ] evidence (test summary, metrics delta, snapshot diff) is recorded in the ticket file before closing
- [ ] every new log event uses the event-line format (ticket 14)
- [ ] every new config key is optional and documented in `proxy/config.example.yaml`
- [ ] any new env override for a `ZCODE_PROXY_*` key goes through the `proxyEnv` exception list with a test
